## Problem 1 (6.3): Extreme operating conditions

Suggest two reasons why reactors are run at elevated pressures and/or temperatures. Be sure to state clearly which explanation is for elevated pressure and which is for elevated temperature.

## Problem 2 (6.10): Feed preparation

It is desired to produce a hot vapor stream of benzene to feed a reactor for a certain petrochemical process. The benzene is available from an off-site storage facility at 1 atm pressure and ambient temperature (assume 25C), and the reactor requires the benzene to be at 250C at 10 atm. Two possible process schemes are being considered to heat and pressurize the feed: (1) Pump the liquid benzene to pressure and then vaporize it in a heat exchanger, and (2) vaporize the benzene first and them compress it to the desired pressure. Answer the following:

a. Discuss qualitatively which scheme (if either) is better. <br>
b. Confirm your answer to Part (a) by comparing the costs using both schemes to feed 1000 kg/h of benzene to the reactor. (Assume that the cost of heating is $15/GJ and that electricity costs $0.06/kWh. *Use Aspen to perform the energy calculations for both the pump and the heat exchanger for both scenarios.*

## Problem 3 (6.11): Cryogenic distillation

One way to produce very pure oxygen and nitrogen is to separate air using a distillation process. For such a separation determine the following:

a. Find the normal boiling point (at 1 atm pressure) of nitrogen and oxygen. <br>
b. For a distillation column operating at 1 atm pressure, what would be the top and bottom temperatures and top and bottom compositions of a distillation column that separates air into nitrogen and oxygen? (For this problem, you may assume that air contains only nitrogen and oxygen and that pure components leave at the top and bottom of the column). <br>
c. At what pressure can oxygen and nitrogen be liquified at ambient temperature (say, 40C)? <br>
d. What does the answer to Part (c) tell you about the potential to distill air at ambient conditions?

*Use Aspen flash tanks and distillation columns to solve a-d.*

## Problem 4 (13.19) Process simulation

For the styrene flowsheet given in Appendix B, Figure B.3.1, list the minimum input information required to obtain mass and energy balances for this process. Using the process simulator available to you, simulate the styrene process and compare your results to those given in Table B.3.1.

*Hint: do NOT try to build the whole plant all at once. I recommend starting from the reactor and building outwards, completing the recycle loop as the last step. A few key hang-ups will be: what is the correct thermodynamics model to use here? How do I enter in the given information on the reaction specified in the problem? Note that you can use the short-cut approaches (perfect separators, stoichiometric reactors, shortcut distillation columns) if you get stuck. Extra credit will be given if you can correctly implement the reactor data given in Appendix B.
